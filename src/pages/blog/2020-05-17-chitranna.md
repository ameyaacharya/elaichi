This traditional South Indian dish is often eaten for breakfast, but can be enjoyed as a light lunch or dinner as well. You can think of it like a very light version of a fried race, the perfect way to use up leftover day-old rice! When finished, the rice is a bright yellow color and has a strong lemony tag. The best part are the crunchy cashews and peanuts! All you need is your spice kit, some rice, a lemon, and cilantro for garnish.


# Ingredients
- 2 cups cooked rice (basmati or any other white rice. Brown rice won’t work here!)
- Small handful of peanuts
- Small handful of cashews
- 1 tbsp ginger, finely chopped
- Juice from 1 lemon
- Handful of chopped cilantro, for garnish

## From your spice kit
- 1⁄2 tsp mustard seeds
- 1⁄2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 dried red chile
- 1 pinch asafoetida
- 1 curry leaf
- 1 tsp turmeric

# Recipe
1. Heat 2 tbsps olive oil in a large skillet or saute pan over medium heat. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the peanuts and cashews and stir continually, frying them until golden and crunchy, 3-4 minutes.
2. Remove the peanuts and cashews from the
oil, and set aside. In the same oil, put in 1⁄2 tsp mustard seeds, 1⁄2 tsp cumin seeds, and a dried red chile. Be careful, this may splatter!
3. After that starts to crackle (should take no more than 30 seconds), add in the chopped ginger, curry leaf and a pinch of asafoetida.
4. After 30 more seconds, add in the turmeric. Your oil should have a great aroma!
5. Add in the cooked rice, mixing well with the oil and spice mixture. Add 1⁄2 tsp of salt now (you may need more to taste). Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the spice mixture is evenly distributed.
6. Remove the pan from the heat and add back the cooked peanuts and cashews.
7. Add in your lemon juice, and mix well.
8. When serving, top with finely chopped cilantro.

# Note
*The dried red chile is just for flavoring, but be careful when you’re eating, since it will be very spicy! You can take it out of the dish after you’re done cooking, if you’d like.*
