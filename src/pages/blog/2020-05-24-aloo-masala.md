If you have potatoes, onions, and your spice kits, you’re in for an easy and delicious treat. This aloo masala is similar to what is served with dosas, or can be made into a delicious sandwich or served with rice or naan. A truly versatile dish!

# Ingredients
- 4 boiled potatoes
- 1 onion*, diced
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp garlic paste or grated garlic (optional)
- 1 tsp salt, plus more to taste
- Chopped cilantro, as garnish

*Either red or white onions work here! Red gives the dish a colorful appearance, white highlights the yellow of the turmeric. White onions tend to be a tad bit sweet.

## From your spice kit
- 1⁄2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1⁄4 tsp red chili powder
- 1⁄2 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp turmeric

# Recipe
1. Peel your boiled potatoes and mash them up, either with your hands, a fork, or a potato masher.
2. Heat the oil in a large skillet / saute pan, and once it’s shimmering add the cumin seeds.
They should start to sputter immediately! You can use a glass lid to cover the pan if the oil starts going everywhere.
3. After 15 seconds, add in your onion. Move the mixture around with a wooden spoon to make sure the cumin and oil is evenly distributed. Sautee for 3-4 minutes, until the onion is soft and translucent.
4. Add the red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric, and salt.
5. Add the mashed potatoes and mix around well so the spices get evenly distributed.
6. Cook for 5-6 minutes, until the potatoes are colorful.
7. Add another 1⁄2 tsp of salt, and possibly more (to taste).
8. Top with chopped cilantro and enjoy! If you want to eat this as a sandwich, grill two slices of bread and spread the potato mixture inside. I personally love dipping this sandwich in ketchup!
