If you’ve been to an Indian restaurant before, chances are you’ve heard of Channa Masala, a hearty dish made with chickpeas and a tomato base. It’s very easy to make and reheats beautifully for leftovers! Serve with basmati rice or roti/naan (the naan from the frozen section of Trader Joe’s is great!). If you like, you can serve with a squeeze of lemon on top at the end.

# Ingredients
- 3 tbsp olive oil (separated into 2 and 1 tbsp at a time)
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 tomatoes, diced, or a can of diced tomatoes would work beautifully here!
- 1 can of chickpeas (about 16oz or 450g)
- 1⁄2 tbsp ginger, chopped
- 1⁄2 tbsp garlic, minced
- 1⁄2 cup water
- 2 tsp salt, plus more to taste
- Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish

## From your spice kit
- 1⁄4 tsp red chile powder
- 1⁄2 tsp turmeric
- 1⁄2 tsp coriander powder
- 1⁄2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 cinnamon stick (about 1 inch long)
- 2 cloves
- 1⁄2 tsp mustard seeds

# Recipe
1. Add 2 tbsp olive oil to a large pot over medium- high heat. When the oil is hot, add Add cumin seeds and cook for 15-20 seconds, until they sizzle and start to go dark brown. (If you’re not sure if your oil is hot enough, put in 1 cumin seed as a test. It should immediately start to sizzle.)
2. Add in the onion and saute until it is transluscent, about 4-5 minutes.
3. Add the ginger and garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
4. Add red chile powder, turmeric, cloves and cinnamon stick, and cook for 1 min until the turmeric has dissolved.
5. Add tomatoes and saute for 8-10 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft. Move the mixture around so it does not stick, and if at any point you see that it is sticking more than expected, feel free to add more oil!
6. Add the chickpeas, 1⁄2 cup of water, and 2 tsp
salt. Lightly break some of the chickpeas with a wooden spoon and cook on medium to medium- low for about 25-30 minutes, until the water has cooked down and the chickpeas are left in a gravy.
7. For the tempering, heat 1 tbsp olive oil. When it begins to shimmer, add the mustard seeds and heat for 15-30 seconds or until the mustard seeds are crackling.
8. Pour the mustard seeds and oil over the chickpeas mixture. Taste for salt and feel free to add more. Garnish with cilantro and enjoy!
